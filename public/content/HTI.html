  <p><b>Haiti</b>'s first Petrocaribe shipment was held up in port for two months. Also, it wasn't officially a Petrocaribe shipment because the agreement had not been signed yet.</p>
  <p>Despite these early hiccups, and serious disputes with international oil companies over the division of responsibility for importing and transporting oil, Haiti's total oil consumption is now 100% covered by Petrocaribe.</p>

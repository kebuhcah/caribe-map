  <p>Despite only officially joining Petrocaribe in 2014, <b>El Salvador</b> has been a recipient of Petrocaribe oil via Nicaragua since as early as 2008, per Wikileaks.</p>
  <p>A group of mayors from the leftist Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion (FMLN) began a "pilot plan" in December 2008 to distribute discounted Venezuelan diesel through six independent "white flag" service stations.</p>

<p>Wikileaks cables also mention FMLN leaders' who claims that Petrocaribe revenue would be used for campaign funding and/or the party's social projects.</p>
<p>Despite complaints from international oil companies that this dumping distorted the market, the Salvadorian government was politically constrained as it did not want to appear to be against low oil prices.</p>
